# rustcommon-datastructures

Collection of datastructures

## Overview

This crate provides basic datastructures such as structures which can produce
summary metrics from recorded data. Most of these datastructures are designed to
be both Send and Sync so that they can be concurrently accessed and updated by
multiple threads. 

## Getting Started

### Building

rustcommon is built with the standard Rust toolchain which can be installed and
managed via [rustup](https://rustup.rs) or by following the directions on the
Rust [website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
